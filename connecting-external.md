# Connecting an external application
{: #connecting-external-app}

Your applications and drivers use connection strings to make a connection to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}}. The service provides connection strings specifically for drivers and applications. 

## Getting Connection Strings

Redis only supports a single-user, so you use the same credentials for all applications that need to connect to your deployment. Documentation for retrieving the deployment's connection strings is on the [Getting Connection Strings](./howto-getting-connection-strings.html) page.

You have to set the admin password before you connect to the database. For more information, see the [Setting the Admin Password](./howto-admin-password.html) page.

## Connecting with a language's client

The information a driver needs to make a connection to your deployment is in the "redis" section of your connection strings. The table contains a breakdown for reference.

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Type`||Type of connection - for Redis, it is "URI"
`Scheme`||Scheme for a URI - for Redis, it is "rediss"
`Path`||Path for a URI - for Redis, it is the database number
`Authentication`|`Username`|The username that you use to connect.
`Authentication`|`Password`|A password for the user - might be shown as `$PASSWORD`
`Authentication`|`Method`|How authentication takes place; "direct" authentication is handled by the driver.
`Hosts`|`0...`|A hostname and port to connect to
`Composed`|`0...`|A URI combining Scheme, Authentication, Host, and Path
`Certificate`|`Name`|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate for database deployment
`Certificate`|Base64|A base64 encoded version of the certificate.
{: caption="Table 1. `redis`/`URI` connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.

Redis drivers are often able to make a connection to your deployment when given the URI-formatted connection string found in the "composed" field of the connection information. For example,
```
rediss://admin:7398b8731c075dcdf02eac76b7860f8e554a668ca8728228bf2250ac07c62310@e6b2c3f8-54a6-439e-8d8a-aa6c4a78df49.8f7bfd8f3faa4218aec56e069eb46187.databases.appdomain.cloud:32371/0
```

Redis has a vast array of clients for applications to use. A fairly [comprehensive list is maintained on the Redis.io site](https://redis.io/clients).

## Driver TLS and self-signed certificate support

All connections to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} are TLS 1.2 enabled, so the driver you use to connect need to be able to support TLS encryption. For {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}}, this means supporting the unofficial `rediss:` protocol in connection strings. 

If your driver does not support the `rediss:` protocol or TLS/SSL connections, it is still possible to tunnel connections to the Redis database endpoint by using a TLS/SSL tunnel application such as Stunnel. An example of using Stunnel can be found on the [Connecting with a Command-line Client](./connecting-cli-client.html) page, where it is used to connect the `redis-cli` application.

### Using the self-signed certificate

Your deployment also comes with a self-signed certificate so the driver can verify the server upon connection.
1. Copy the certificate information from the Base64 field of the connection information. 
2. Decode the Base64 string into text and save it to a file. (You can use the Name that is provided or your own file name).
3. Set the TLS/SSL parameters in your driver to use a certificate and provide the path to the driver.

### CLI plug-in support for the self-signed certificate

You can display the decoded certificate for your deployment with the CLI plug-in with the command `ibmcloud cdb deployment-cacert "your-service-name"`. It decodes the base64 into text. Copy and save the command's output to a file and provide the file's path to the driver.
