# Connecting an external application
{: #connecting-external-app}

Your applications and drivers use connection strings to make a connection to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}}. The service provides connection strings specifically for drivers and applications. 

## Getting Connection Strings

The easiest way to get connection strings for an application is to create a set of _Service Credentials_ specifically for your application to connect with. Doing so also returns all the connection information as JSON in a click-to-copy field. Full documentation on generating and retrieving connection strings is on the [Getting Connection Strings](./work-with-connection-strings.html) page.

Other options for getting connection strings are through the [CLI cloud databases plug-in](./work-with-connection-strings.html#generating-connection-strings-from-the-command-line), and the [cloud databases API](https://pages.github.ibm.com/compose/apidocs/). A [table](./working-connection-strings#the-redis-section) with a breakdown of all the connection information is included for reference.

## Connecting with a language's client

Redis has a vast array of clients for applications to use. A fairly [comprehensive list is maintained on the Redis.io site](https://redis.io/clients).

## Driver TLS and self-signed certificate support

All connections to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} are TLS 1.2 enabled, so the driver you use to connect need to be able to support encryption. Your deployment also comes with a self-signed certificate so the driver can verify the server upon connection. In most cases, you want to decode and save a copy of the certificate, and then provide the path to the driver. For more information, see [Using the self-signed certificate](./work-with-connection-strings.html#using-the-self-signed-certificate).
