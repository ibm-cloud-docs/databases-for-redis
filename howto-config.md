# Changing the Redis Configuration
{: #changing-configuration}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} allows you to change some of the Redis configuration settings so you can tune your databases to your use-case. In a typical Redis setting, you can change the configuration from the command-line. You can still change your configuration at any time using `CONFIG SET` in a cli-client. However, these changes will NOT persist in the event of a failover, node restart, or other event on your deployment. Changing the configuration from the CLI can be used for testing, evaluation, and tuning purposes.

To make permanent changes to the database configuration, you want to use the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} [cli-plugin](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-databases-cli-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration) or [API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration) to write the changes to the configuration file for your deployment. 

The configuration is defined in a schema. When you change the the configuration via the API or the CLI, you make changes to the configuration's JSON schema. To make a change, you make a JSON object with the settings and their new values. For example, to set the `maxmemory` setting , you would supply 
```
{"configuration":{"maxmemory":""}}
```
to either the CLI or to the API.

## Using the CLI

To change your configuration through the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} cli-plugin, use `deployment-configuration` command. 
```
ibmcloud cdb deployment-configuration <deployment name or CRN> [@JSON_FILE | JSON_STRING]
```

The command reads the changes you would like to make from the JSON object or a file. For more information, see the [reference page](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-databases-cli-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration).

## Using the API

There are two deployment-configuration endpoints, one for viewing the configuration schema and one for changing the configuration. To view the configuration schema, send a `GET` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration/schema`.

To change the configuration, send the settings you would like to change as a JSON object in the request body of a `PATCH` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration)


## Available Configuration settings

To check the current value of a setting, use [`CONFIG GET`](https://redis.io/commands/config-get) from a [CLI client](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-connecting-cli-client). You can check all of the settings by using `CONFIG GET *`.

Many of the settings below are used to configure Redis as a cache. For more information, see the [Configuring Redis as a Cache](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-redis-cache) page.

Setting|Default|Notes
----------|-----|-----------
[`maxmemory`](https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization#memory-allocation) | 85% of your deployment's memory | Determines the amount of data you can store in Redis.
[`appendonly`](https://redis.io/topics/persistence#append-only-file)| `yes` | Enables or Disables Redis persistence.
[`maxmemory-policy`](https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache#eviction-policies) |`noeviction` | Determines eviction behavior when `maxmemory` limit is reached.
[`maxmemory-samples`](https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache#approximated-lru-algorithm) | `5`| Tunes LRU eviction algorithm when Redis is configured as a cache.
`stop-writes-on-bgsave-error` | `yes` | Redis stops accepting writes if it detects an unsuccessful backup snapshot.
