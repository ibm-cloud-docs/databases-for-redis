# Changing the Redis Configuration
{: #changing-configuration}

In {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}}, you can change some of the Redis configuration settings to tune your databases to your use-case. In a typical Redis setting, you can change the configuration from the command line by using [`CONFIG SET`](https://redis.io/commands/config-set). You can still use `CONFIG SET` on your deployment but the changes do NOT persist if there is a failover, node restart, or other event on your deployment. Changing the configuration with `CONFIG SET` can be used for testing, evaluation, and tuning purposes.

Please note the following Redis configuration restrictions: 
* Redis 4: to fix critical CVEs, `CONFIG` and all subcommands are no longer exposed
* Redis 5: no restrictions
* Redis 6 (and newer): only `CONFIG GET` and `CONFIG RESETSTAT` are exposed

To make permanent changes to the database configuration, you want to use the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} [cli-plugin](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration) or [API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration) to write the changes to the configuration file for your deployment. 

To make a change, you send a JSON object with the settings that you want to change and their new values. For example, to set the `maxmemory-policy` setting, you would supply 
```shell
{"configuration":{"maxmemory-policy":"allkeys-lru"}}
```
{: .pre}

to either the CLI or to the API. 

## Using the CLI
{: #using-cli}

You can view the configuration schema of possible settings through the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} cli-plugin with the `cdb deployment-configuration-schema` command.
```shell
ibmcloud cdb deployment-configuration-schema <deployment name or CRN>
```
{: .pre}

To change your configuration, use the `cdb deployment-configuration` command. 
```shell
ibmcloud cdb deployment-configuration <deployment name or CRN> [@JSON_FILE | JSON_STRING]
```
{: .pre}

The command reads the changes that you would like to make from the JSON object or a file. For more information, see the [reference page](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration).

## Using the API
{: #using-api}

There are two deployment-configuration endpoints, one for viewing the configuration schema and one for changing the configuration. To view the configuration schema, send a `GET` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration/schema`.

To change the configuration, send the settings that you would like to change as a JSON object in the request body of a `PATCH` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration).


## Available Configuration settings
{: # config-settings}

To check the current value of a setting, use [`CONFIG GET`](https://redis.io/commands/config-get) from a [CLI client](/docs/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-connecting-cli-client). You can check all of the settings by using `CONFIG GET *`.

Many of the settings are used to configure Redis as a cache. For more information, see the [Configuring Redis as a Cache](/docs/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-redis-cache) page.

Setting|Default|Notes
----------|-----|-----------
[`maxmemory`](https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization#memory-allocation) | 80% of your deployment's memory | Determines the amount of data you can store in Redis.
[`appendonly`](https://redis.io/topics/persistence#append-only-file)| `yes` | Enables or Disables Redis persistence.
[`maxmemory-policy`](https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache#eviction-policies) |`noeviction` | Determines eviction behavior when `maxmemory` limit is reached.
[`maxmemory-samples`](https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache#approximated-lru-algorithm) | `5`| Tunes LRU eviction algorithm when Redis is configured as a cache.
`stop-writes-on-bgsave-error` | `yes` | Redis stops accepting writes if it detects an unsuccessful backup snapshot.
