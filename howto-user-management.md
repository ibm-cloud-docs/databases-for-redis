# Managing Users and Roles
{: #user-management}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} deployments come with authentication enabled and use Redis's built-in access control. Redis 5.x and below only supported a single admin user. Redis 6 introduced [Access Control List (ACL) support](https://redis.io/topics/acl), so if you are able to upgrade, you should do so to take advantage of multiple users and authentication.

## The admin user

When you provision a new deployment in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you are automatically given access to the admin user. If you are using Redis 5.x and below, the admin user is the only user available on your deployment. If you are using Redis 6.x and above you have the admin user and the ability to create additional users and credentials.

You have to [set the admin password](/docs/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-admin-password) in order to use it to connect to your deployment.

## Redis roles

The admin user and all other users on your deployment have full access to the set of redis commands, with the exception of the subcommand `configure set` - this includes the admin user.

In Redis 6.x and above, any user that you create, whether through _Service Credentials_, the CLI, the API, or directly in Redis all have this same set of access. You can use Redis itself to create roles with access limited to specific keys or ranges of keys. Refer to the redis documentation for [commands to manage roles](https://redis.io/topics/acl#configuring-acls-using-the-acl-command).

## Additional Users - Redis 6.x only

Access to your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} deployment is not limited to the admin user. You can create users by using the _Service Credentials_ panel, the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} CLI, or through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API. 

All users on your deployment can use the connection strings, including connection strings for either public or private endpoints. 

### Creating Users From _Service Credentials_

1. Navigate to the service dashboard for your service.
2. Click _Service Credentials_ to open the _Service Credentials_ panel.
3. Click **New Credential**.
4. Choose a descriptive name for your new credential. 
5. (Optional) Specify if the new credentials should use a public or private endpoint. Use either `{ "service-endpoints": "public" }` / `{ "service-endpoints": "private" }` in the _Add Inline Configuration Parameters_ field to generate connection strings using the specified endpoint. Use of the endpoint is not enforced, it just controls which hostnames are in the connection strings. Public endpoints are generated by default.
6. Click **Add** to provision the new credentials. A username and password, and an associated {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} user is auto-generated.

The new credentials appear in the table, and the connection strings are available as JSON in a click-to-copy field under _View Credentials_.

### Creating Users From the Command Line

If you manage your service through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the [cloud databases plug-in](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), you can create a new user with `cdb user-create`. For example, to create a new user for an "example-deployment", use the following command.
```
ibmcloud cdb user-create example-deployment <newusername> <newpassword>
```

Once the task has finished, you can retrieve the new user's connection strings with the `ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections` command.

### Creating Users from the API

The _Foundation Endpoint_ that is shown on the _Overview_ panel of your service provides the base URL to access this deployment through the API. To create and manage users, use the base URL with the `/users` endpoint.
```
curl -X POST 'https://api.{region}.databases.cloud.ibm.com/v4/ibm/deployments/{id}/users' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $APIKEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"jane_smith", "password":"newsupersecurepassword"}'
```

To retrieve a user's connection strings, use the base URL with the `/users/{userid}/connections` endpoint.

## Internal-use Users - Redis 6.x only

There are four reserved users on your deployment. Modifying these users will cause your deployment to become unstable or unusable.
- `ibm` - An internal admin user used for managing the deployment and exposing metrics.
- `replication-user` - The user account that is used for replication.
- `sentinel-user` - The user account for sentinels to handle monitoring and failovers.
- `admin` - The default user provided to access your deployment.
