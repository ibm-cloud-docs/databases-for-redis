{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} deployments deployments can be both manually [to your usage](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-resources-scaling), or configured to [autoscale](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-autoscaling) under certain resource conditions. There are a few factors to consider if you are tuning the performance of your deployment.

## Monitoring your deployment

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} deployments offer an integration with the [Sysdig Monitoring service](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-sysdig-monitoring) for basic monitoring of resource usage on your deployment. Many of the available metrics, like disk usage and IOPS, are presented to help you configure [autoscaling](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-autoscaling) on your deployment. Observing trends in your usage and configuring the autoscaling to respond to them can help alleviate performance problems before your databases become unstable due to resource exhaustion.

## Memory Policies

By default, deployments are configured with a `noeviction` policy. All data is kept in memory until the `maxmemory` limit is reached and Redis returns an error if the memory limit is exceeded. The `maxmemory` is set to 80% of a data node's available memory, so your node doesn't run out of system resources. 

You can scale the amount of memory to accommodate more data, and you can configure the `maxmemory` setting to tune memory usage. The [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization#memory-allocation) has some good information on memory behavior and tuning `maxmemory`.

You can also configure your deployment to use [Redis as a cache](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-redis-cache), allowing Redis to evict data out of memory once the memory limit is reached. 

## Disk IOPS

The number of Input-Output Operations per second (IOPS) is limited by the type of storage volume. Storage volumes for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} deployments are provisioned on [Block Storage Endurance Volumes in the 10 IOPS per GB tier](/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-About#provendurance). By default, a deployment starts with persistence enabled. It's possible for very busy databases to exceed the IOPS for the disk size, and increasing disk can alleviate a performance bottleneck.
