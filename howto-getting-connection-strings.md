# Getting Connection Strings
{: #connection-strings}

The {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} service is provisioned with authentication enabled. You need a username and password to connect and issue commands. The username for Redis is always "admin".

You have to set the admin password before you connect to the database. For more information, see the [Setting the Admin Password](/docs/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-admin-password) page.
{: .tip}

Connection Strings for your deployment are displayed on the _Dashboard Overview_, in the _Connections_ panel.

## The _Service Credentials_ panel

It is possible to make the "admin" connection information available the in _Service Credentials_ panel. 
1. Navigate to the service dashboard for your service.
2. Click _Service Credentials_ to open the _Service Credentials_ panel.
3. Click **New Credential**.
4. Choose a descriptive name for the credential, if wanted.
5. (Optional) Specify if the credentials should use a public or private endpoint. Use either `{ "service-endpoints": "public" }` / `{ "service-endpoints": "private" }` in the _Add Inline Configuration Parameters_ field to generate connection strings using the specified endpoint. Use of the endpoint is not enforced, it just controls which hostnames are in the connection strings. Public endpoints are generated by default.
6. Click **Add**.

Redis does not support multiple users. Adding more service credentials does not give you more users. It just reuses the admin credentials.
{: .tip}

The admin credentials appear in the table, and the connection strings are available as JSON in a click-to-copy field under _View Credentials_. The JSON object contains the same fields as Table 1 and Table 2. 

## Getting Connection Strings from the CLI

You can retrieve connection information is from the [cloud databases plug-in](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-databases-cli-cdb-reference). Use the `ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections` command to display a formatted connection URI for your deployment. For example, to retrieve a connection string for a deployment named  "NewRedis", use the following command.

```
ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections NewRedis [--endpoint-type <endpoint type>]
```

Full connection information is returned by the `ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections` command with the `--all` flag. Retrieve all the connection information for a deployment named  "NewRedis", use the following command.

```
ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections NewRedis --all [--endpoint-type <endpoint type>]
```

If you don't specify an endpoint type, the connection string returns the public endpoint by default. If your deployment only has a private endpoint, you have to specify `--endpoint-type private` or the commands return an error.

## Getting Connection Strings from the API

Connection information also available as JSON from the cloud databases API. The _Foundation Endpoint_ that is shown on the _Overview_ panel of your service provides the base URL to access this deployment through the API.

To retrieve connection strings, use the base URL with the `/users/{userid}/connections` endpoint. You have to specify in the path which type of endpoint (public or private) should be used in the returned connection strings. The endpoint type is not enforced. You can use any user on your deployment with either endpoint (if both exist on your deployment).
```
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIKEY" 'https://api.{region}.databases.cloud.ibm.com/v4/ibm/deployments/{id}/users/admin/connections/{endpoint_type}'
```

## Connection String Breakdown

### The Redis Section

The "Redis" section contains information that is suited for your applications that make connections to Redis.

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Type`||Type of connection - for Redis, it is "URI"
`Scheme`||Scheme for a URI - for Redis, it is "rediss"
`Path`||Path for a URI - for Redis, it is the database number
`Authentication`|`Username`|The username that you use to connect.
`Authentication`|`Password`|A password for the user - might be shown as `$PASSWORD`
`Authentication`|`Method`|How authentication takes place; "direct" authentication is handled by the driver.
`Hosts`|`0...`|A hostname and port to connect to
`Composed`|`0...`|A URI combining Scheme, Authentication, Host, and Path
`Certificate`|`Name`|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate for database deployment
`Certificate`|Base64|A base64 encoded version of the certificate.
{: caption="Table 1. `redis`/`URI` connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.

For more information on using this information to connect, see the [Connecting an External Application](/docs/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-external-app) page.

### The CLI Section

The "CLI" section contains information that is suited for command-line clients that make connections to Redis.

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Bin`||The recommended binary to create a connection; in this case it is `redli`.
`Composed`||A formatted command to establish a connection to your deployment. The command combines the `Bin` executable, `Environment` variable settings and uses `Arguments` as command line parameters.
`Environment`||A list of key/values you set as environment variables.
`Arguments`|0...|The information that is passed as arguments to the command shown in the Bin field.
`Certificate`|Base64|A self-signed certificate that is used to confirm that an application is connecting to the appropriate server. It is base64 encoded.
`Certificate`|Name|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate.
`Type`||The type of package that uses this connection information; in this case `cli`. 
{: caption="Table 2. `redis`/`cli` connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.

For more information on using this information, see the [Connecting with a command line client](/docs/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-connecting-cli-client) page.
