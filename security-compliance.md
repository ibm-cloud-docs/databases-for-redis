# Architecture, Security, and Compliance
{: #architecture-security-compliance}


## Protection Against Unauthorized Access

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} use the following methods to protect data in transit or in storage.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} connections use TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit. The current supported version of this encryption is TLS 1.2.
- Access to the Account, Management Console UI, and API is secured via [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-iam).
- Access to the database is secured through the standard access controls provided by the database. These access controls are configured to require valid database-level credentials that are obtainable only through prior access to the database or through our Management Console UI or API.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} storage is provided on storage encrypted with [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about). Bring-your-own-key (BYOK) for encryption is also available through [Key Protect integration](/docs/services/databases-for-redis?topic=databases-for-redis-key-protect. 
- IP Whitelisting - All deployments support whitelisting IP addresses to restrict access to the service.

## Data Resilience

- Backups are included in the service. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} backups reside in [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-ibm-cloud-object-storage) and are also [encrypted](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-security).
- Memory usage is configured with a `noeviction` policy and a max memory usage of 80% of available memory.
- The data persistence model uses [preamble snapshots and AOF (Append Only File)](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} deployments are configured with replication, 
deployments contain a cluster with two data members in a master/replica configuration and state is managed with a quorum of three [Redis sentinels](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel).
- If you deploy to an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} datacenter](/docs/overview?topic=overview-data_center#data_center), your data has multiple copies and each copy resides on a different host. If you deploy to a [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Global location](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/), the cluster is spread over the region's availability zone locations. If one data member becomes unreachable, your cluster continues to operate normally.
