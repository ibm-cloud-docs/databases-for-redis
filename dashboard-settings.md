# Settings

Manage your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} service through these available settings.

## Scaling Resources

The _Scale Resources_ panel shows the current size and resource allocation for your deployment. You can manage the available resources for your deployment by adjusting the groups of resources. 

Resources that are not scalable are grayed out. They are shown for informational purposes only.
{: .tip} 

**Storage** - Storage shows the amount of disk space that is allocated to your service. Each container gets the allocated space. Your data is replicated across two data containers in the PostgreSQL cluster, so the total amount of storage you are using is roughly twice the size of your data.

**Memory** - If you find that your queries and database activity suffer from performance issues due to a lack of memory, you can scale the amount of RAM allocated to your service. Your PostgreSQL deployment runs with two containers in a cluster, so the amount of memory you add is added to both containers. 

Scaling operations can cause downtime. When the scaling is complete the Deployment Details pane updates to show the current usage and the new values for the available storage and memory. 

Billing is based on the _total_ amount of resources that are allocated to the service.

### Scaling via the UI

Adjust the slider to increase or decrease the resources that are allocated to your service. Click **Scale** to trigger the scaling operations and return to the dashboard overview.

### Scaling via the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI cloud databases plug-in

Use the command `cdb deployment-groups` to see current resource information for your service, including which resource groups are adjustable. To scale any of the available resource groups, use `cdb deployment-groups-set` command. 

For example, to view the resource groups for a deployment named "example-deployment":  
`ibmcloud cdb deployment-groups example-deployment`

To scale the memory to 2048 MB of RAM for each memory member of "example-deployment":  
`ibmcloud cdb deployment-groups-set member --memory 2048`

### Scaling via the API

The _Foundation Endpoint_ that is shown on the _Overview_ panel of your service provides the base URL to access this deployment through the API. Use it with the `/groups` endpoint if you need to manage or automate scaling programmatically.

You can find more examples in the [API Reference](https://console.{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#get-currently-available-scaling-groups-from-a-depl).

## Setting the admin Password

In order to connect to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis} , you have to set the admin password. You might also need to change the password of your service. You can do so by using _Update Password_.

A new, randomly generated password appears, or you can type your own password into the field. To regenerate another password, click the icon to the right of the field. When you click *Update Password*, you will be asked to confirm before the change is applied. 

**Note:** Changing the password changes the credentials that you or any other services that use the admin user to connect. It can cause these services to disconnect and experience downtime.

## Whitelisting

If you want to restrict access to your databases, you can whitelist specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses on your deployment. When there are no IP addresses in the whitelist, the whitelist is disabled and the deployment will accept connections from any system on the internet.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} management services will still be able to connect.
{: .tip}

### IP Addresses

The *IP* field can take a single complete IPv4 address or IPv6 address with or without a netmask. Without a netmask, incoming connections must come from exactly that IP address. 

Although the *IP* field allows for IPv6, no deployments are currently available to IPv6 networking and so these addresses cannot be filtered on.
{: tip}

### Netmasks

To allow a connection from a specified range of IP addresses, use a netmask. The IP address must be fully specified when using a netmask. That means entering, for example, 192.168.1.0/24 rather than 192.168.1/24.

### Description

The *Description* can be any user-significant text for identifying the whitelist entry - a customer name, project identifier, or employee number, for example. The description field is required.

### Removal

To remove an IP address or netmask from the Whitelist, click *Remove*.
When all entries on the whitelist are removed, the whitelist will be disabled and all IP addresses are accepted by the TCP access portals.
